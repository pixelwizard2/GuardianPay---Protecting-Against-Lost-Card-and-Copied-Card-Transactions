비정상적인 거래 패턴 식별 및 복제 카드 결제 방지 프로그램(NLP)



## Project Introduction (프로젝트 소개)

Credit card payments are one of the indispensable convenient payment methods in modern society. However, issues such as card information leakage, duplication, and unauthorized usage continue to rise. This threatens the financial security of individuals and businesses. To address these issues, the "GuardianPay" project was initiated.  


## Project Goals (프로젝트 목표)

The main goals of the "GuardianPay" project are as follows:
- Establish a system to detect abnormal card payment behavior and issue warnings.
- Block transactions that appear suspicious during payment attempts and notify cardholders.
- Utilize real-time data analysis and machine learning algorithms for more accurate detection of fraudulent behavior.


## Project Technology Stack (프로젝트 기술 스택)

The "GuardianPay" project uses the following technology stack:
- Language: Python
- Machine learning and deep learning libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Data analysis and visualization: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Web application development (optional): Flask, HTML, CSS


## Project Workflow (프로젝트 진행 방식)

The project will proceed in the following steps:
1. Data Collection: Collect card payment data from sources like Kaggle.
2. Data Preprocessing: Refine collected data and process it into the required format.
3. Model Development: Develop and train machine learning and deep learning models.
4. System Implementation: Build a system to detect abnormal card payment behavior in real-time using the models.
5. Web Application (optional): Develop a web application for cardholders to monitor their payment activities.
